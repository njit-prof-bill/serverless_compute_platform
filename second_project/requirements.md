## **AI-Powered Resume Analyzer and Job Matcher**
### **Introduction**
   - **Description**: A platform where users can upload resumes and receive feedback on improving them, with personalized job recommendations based on resume content.
   - **Tech Stack**: Backend for handling resumes and feedback; an API to communicate between the front end and NLP model.
   - **New Technology**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze resumes, along with machine learning to match jobs to resume keywords and skills.
   - **Challenge Level**: This would involve building an NLP pipeline, working with text data processing, and providing meaningful feedback to users, which would be a rewarding challenge.

### **Summary**
   - **Summary**: This app would enable students to upload their resumes and receive AI-driven feedback, such as suggestions on wording, structure, and missing skills. Additionally, it could recommend job listings or career paths based on the resume’s content, comparing keywords and skills with job market trends.
   - **Technical Focus**: The project would use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and parse resume text, along with machine learning techniques to offer job recommendations or skill gap analysis.
   - **Core Skills Developed**: Parsing and analyzing text with NLP, managing sensitive data securely, designing a user-friendly feedback system, and integrating job recommendation APIs or data sources.

   - **Core MVP Features**:
     - Upload resume functionality with simple text parsing.
     - Basic NLP analysis to highlight missing skills or format suggestions (focusing on predefined keywords).
     - Basic job matching using a limited dataset of sample job descriptions.
   - **Stretch Goal**: Integrate real-time job data from an API, if feasible.
   - **Scope Tips**: Simplify the feedback by focusing on core keywords and simple structure analysis, avoiding complex NLP tasks like semantic understanding.

**General Strategies for Success**:
- **Use Existing Tools/Libraries**: Rely on pre-trained AI models or existing blockchain libraries to accelerate development.
- **Prioritize Core Functionality**: Stick to the core feature that demonstrates the unique technology (NLP for the Study Tool, AI feedback for the Resume Analyzer, blockchain verification for the Transcript project).
- **Focus on Simple UI**: Ensure the front end is functional but not overly complex to allow more time on backend and technical integration.

Got it! Adjusting the requirements as per your updated goals, we’ll simplify the system by removing the need for persistent storage and focusing more on analyzing resumes against job descriptions to assess fit and suggest improvements. This change not only reduces complexity but also avoids relying on external cloud storage services, making it more achievable within the class project timeframe.

Here’s the revised breakdown of requirements and project structure.

### MVP Requirements

#### 1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Allow users to sign up with an email and password.
     - Implement login and logout functionalities.
     - Use session management to keep users logged in securely.
   - **Notes**: OAuth (e.g., Google or GitHub) can be an optional stretch goal.

#### 2. **Resume and Job Description Input**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Users can upload their resume as a PDF or Word document, **or** copy-paste the resume text directly into a form.
     - Users can also upload or paste a job description they are interested in.
     - The system should temporarily store the input data for processing but **not persist it** after the session ends.
   - **Notes**: File size validation (e.g., max 2MB) should be applied for document uploads.

#### 3. **AI-Powered Resume Analysis and Job Matching**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the resume content and the job description.
     - Determine if the resume aligns with the job requirements and calculate a "fit score."
     - Provide feedback on how well the resume matches the job description.
     - Suggest improvements to the resume to increase the candidate’s chances of getting an interview, such as adding relevant skills, keywords, or adjusting wording.
   - **Notes**: Leverage pre-trained NLP models like Hugging Face's transformers, SpaCy, or OpenAI for text analysis.

#### 4. **Real-Time Feedback and Suggestions**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Once users upload or paste their resume and job description, provide instant feedback on the alignment.
     - Display suggestions for resume enhancements directly on the dashboard.
     - Allow users to download a report of the suggestions if needed.
   - **Notes**: Keep the user interface clean and straightforward, focusing on readability and actionable advice.

### Optional Enhancements (Stretch Goals)
1. **Enhanced NLP Analysis**: 
   - Allow users to select job roles or industries to fine-tune recommendations.
2. **Resume Scoring History**:
   - Allow users to see their past "fit scores" (only for the current session; no persistent storage).
3. **Email Notifications**:
   - Optionally, send users a summary of feedback via email.
4. **Interactive Resume Editor**:
   - Allow users to edit their resume text directly on the platform with real-time feedback.

---

### Updated Tech Stack Guidelines
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) or Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js
- **Database**: Not required, as data is temporarily stored in memory.
- **APIs**: 
  - Use Hugging Face, SpaCy, or OpenAI GPT models for NLP analysis.
- **Deployment**: Use services like Netlify or Vercel for frontend, and Render or Heroku for backend.

---

### Updated Sprint Breakdown

#### **Sprint 1 (2 Weeks)**
- Set up project repository, CI/CD pipeline, and basic folder structure.
- Implement user registration, authentication, and dashboard layout.
- Build the resume and job description input functionality (upload and text fields).
- Integrate an NLP model to analyze the resume and job description.

#### **Sprint 2 (2 Weeks)**
- Implement the fit score algorithm and feedback generation.
- Create the dashboard to display resume feedback and job matching results.
- Allow users to download a report with suggested resume improvements.
- Perform testing and debugging to ensure smooth user experience.

### Sample User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to upload my resume and a job description to see if I'm qualified for the job.
2. **As a user**, I want to receive suggestions on how to improve my resume to increase my chances of getting an interview.
3. **As a user**, I want to get instant feedback without needing to store any data permanently.
4. **As a developer**, I want to use pre-trained NLP models to analyze text inputs and generate actionable feedback.
