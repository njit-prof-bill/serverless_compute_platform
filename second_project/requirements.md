### **AI-Powered Resume Analyzer and Job Matcher**
## **Introduction**
   - **Description**: A platform where users can upload resumes and receive feedback on improving them, with personalized job recommendations based on resume content.
   - **Tech Stack**: Backend for handling resumes and feedback; an API to communicate between the front end and NLP model.
   - **New Technology**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze resumes, along with machine learning to match jobs to resume keywords and skills.
   - **Challenge Level**: This would involve building an NLP pipeline, working with text data processing, and providing meaningful feedback to users, which would be a rewarding challenge.

## **Summary**
   - **Summary**: This app would enable students to upload their resumes and receive AI-driven feedback, such as suggestions on wording, structure, and missing skills. Additionally, it could recommend job listings or career paths based on the resumeâ€™s content, comparing keywords and skills with job market trends.
   - **Technical Focus**: The project would use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and parse resume text, along with machine learning techniques to offer job recommendations or skill gap analysis.
   - **Core Skills Developed**: Parsing and analyzing text with NLP, managing sensitive data securely, designing a user-friendly feedback system, and integrating job recommendation APIs or data sources.

## **AI-Powered Resume Analyzer and Job Matcher**
   - **Core MVP Features**:
     - Upload resume functionality with simple text parsing.
     - Basic NLP analysis to highlight missing skills or format suggestions (focusing on predefined keywords).
     - Basic job matching using a limited dataset of sample job descriptions.
   - **Stretch Goal**: Integrate real-time job data from an API, if feasible.
   - **Scope Tips**: Simplify the feedback by focusing on core keywords and simple structure analysis, avoiding complex NLP tasks like semantic understanding.

**General Strategies for Success**:
- **Use Existing Tools/Libraries**: Rely on pre-trained AI models or existing blockchain libraries to accelerate development.
- **Prioritize Core Functionality**: Stick to the core feature that demonstrates the unique technology (NLP for the Study Tool, AI feedback for the Resume Analyzer, blockchain verification for the Transcript project).
- **Focus on Simple UI**: Ensure the front end is functional but not overly complex to allow more time on backend and technical integration.
