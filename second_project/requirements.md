## **AI-Powered Resume Analyzer and Job Matcher**
### **Introduction**
   - **Description**: A platform where users can upload resumes and receive feedback on improving them, with personalized job recommendations based on resume content.
   - **Tech Stack**: Backend for handling resumes and feedback; an API to communicate between the front end and NLP model.
   - **New Technology**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze resumes, along with machine learning to match jobs to resume keywords and skills.
   - **Challenge Level**: This would involve building an NLP pipeline, working with text data processing, and providing meaningful feedback to users, which would be a rewarding challenge.

### **Summary**
   - **Summary**: This app would enable students to upload their resumes and receive AI-driven feedback, such as suggestions on wording, structure, and missing skills. Additionally, it could recommend job listings or career paths based on the resume’s content, comparing keywords and skills with job market trends.
   - **Technical Focus**: The project would use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and parse resume text, along with machine learning techniques to offer job recommendations or skill gap analysis.
   - **Core Skills Developed**: Parsing and analyzing text with NLP, managing sensitive data securely, designing a user-friendly feedback system, and integrating job recommendation APIs or data sources.

   - **Core MVP Features**:
     - Upload resume functionality with simple text parsing.
     - Basic NLP analysis to highlight missing skills or format suggestions (focusing on predefined keywords).
     - Basic job matching using a limited dataset of sample job descriptions.
   - **Stretch Goal**: Integrate real-time job data from an API, if feasible.
   - **Scope Tips**: Simplify the feedback by focusing on core keywords and simple structure analysis, avoiding complex NLP tasks like semantic understanding.

**General Strategies for Success**:
- **Use Existing Tools/Libraries**: Rely on pre-trained AI models or existing blockchain libraries to accelerate development.
- **Prioritize Core Functionality**: Stick to the core feature that demonstrates the unique technology (NLP for the Study Tool, AI feedback for the Resume Analyzer, blockchain verification for the Transcript project).
- **Focus on Simple UI**: Ensure the front end is functional but not overly complex to allow more time on backend and technical integration.

### Updated MVP Requirements with API Architecture

#### 1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Allow users to sign up with an email and password.
     - Implement login and logout functionalities using a secure authentication method.
     - Maintain session management to keep users logged in.
   - **API Requirements**:
     - **REST**, **GraphQL**, or **gRPC API** must handle registration, authentication, and user sessions.
   - **Tech Stack**:
     - If using Python: Implement using **FastAPI**.
     - If using Node.js: Use **Express** or **NestJS**.

#### 2. **Resume and Job Description Input**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Users can upload a resume as a PDF or paste in text directly.
     - Users can upload or paste in a job description.
     - No persistent storage of files—data should be temporarily held in memory for processing.
   - **API Requirements**:
     - Expose endpoints to accept uploaded files and text inputs via a **REST**, **GraphQL**, or **gRPC API**.
     - Validate inputs (e.g., file size/type and character limits for pasted text).
   - **Tech Stack**:
     - FastAPI with file and text parsing capabilities.

#### 3. **AI-Powered Resume Analysis and Job Matching**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Utilize an NLP model to analyze resume content against job descriptions.
     - Assess whether the resume aligns with the job requirements and assign a "fit score."
     - Provide feedback on how to improve the resume for better alignment with the job description.
   - **API Requirements**:
     - Implement an API endpoint that:
       - Accepts resume text and job description as inputs.
       - Sends the data to an AI API for analysis.
       - Processes and returns the fit score and improvement suggestions in a structured JSON format.
   - **NLP Guidelines**:
     - Students must use a **free AI API** (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) but must conform to standardized input and output formats.
     - The API should receive JSON inputs and return structured JSON outputs.
     - Example Input:
       ```json
       {
         "resume_text": "Your resume content here...",
         "job_description": "Your job description here..."
       }
       ```
     - Example Output:
       ```json
       {
         "fit_score": 85,
         "feedback": [
           "Add skills related to project management.",
           "Improve your summary section to include specific achievements."
         ]
       }
       ```

#### 4. **Real-Time Feedback and Suggestions**
   - **Functionality**:
     - Once users provide their resume and job description, display real-time feedback on a dashboard.
     - Allow users to download a report with suggestions if needed.
   - **API Requirements**:
     - Use the chosen API architecture (REST/GraphQL/gRPC) to fetch feedback from the backend and display it on the frontend.

### Updated Tech Stack Guidelines
- **Backend**:
  - Python with **FastAPI** (preferred for Python-based projects).
  - Node.js with **Express** or **NestJS** (if using JavaScript).
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js or Vue.js for UI.
- **NLP API**:
  - Use free AI APIs like **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, or others that support NLP.
  - Conform to specified input/output guidelines for the AI integration.
- **Communication Protocol**:
  - Use **REST**, **GraphQL**, or **gRPC** for frontend-backend communication.
